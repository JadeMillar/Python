#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#Integer

a=5 

#Float

b=3.45

#String

c="string"
name="Jade"

#boolean

d=True
p=False 

#list

a=[3,4,5,6]

#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

varA=1
vara=2

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

Var=4


Var="string"

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

VarTwo=Var 

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

b=[a, varA,Var]

a=varA

print(list)
print(list[0])
#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first item
#in that list:

string="Jade"

print(string[0])
#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print("string")
print(True)
#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors

=4
4=var
