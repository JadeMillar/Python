This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

y= ("Jade" == "Jade")
print(y)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

v= (4 == 4) 
print(v)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

w= (3 > 2)
print(w)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

a= (16 < 45)
print(a)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

b= (4 >= 4)
print(b)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x= (4 <= 10)
print(x)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
