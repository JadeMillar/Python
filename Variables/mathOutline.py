#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y="name"+"your"
print(y)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x=5+6
print(x)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x=4-3
print(x)


#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y= 12.5-4.6
print(y)
#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x=4*4
print(x)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

x="jade" * 4
print(x)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x=4/4
print(x)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

a= 13.5/2.6
print(a)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x=5 % 4
print(x)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x= 4 // 4
print(x)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x=2 ** 2
print(x)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

x==2+2
